If you want to open the HTML files locally, you need to run a local server. Or Disable CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in your browser. If you disable CORS make sure to re-enable it after you are done, there could be security issues if you leave it disabled.

To run a local server to host your files:

1. Install Python 3.10.0 or higher
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you have the HTML files
3. Run `python -m http.server 8000` or `/usr/local/bin/python3.10 -m http.server 8000` if you have multiple versions of Python installed
4. Open a browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
5. Navigate to the HTML Directory and select the HTML file [select_crop_num.html](http://localhost:8000/HTML/select_crop_num.html)
